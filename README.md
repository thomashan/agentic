# Knowledge Share for AI, LLM, Agents (Local and Cloud)

This repository is a collection of knowledge and resources related to AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and agents, Ã¸both in local and cloud environments. It aims to provide a comprehensive guide for developers,
researchers, and enthusiasts interested in these fields.

There maybe some code which I intend to keep as a working example, but the main focus is on knowledge sharing.

If you find this repository useful, please consider giving it a star on GitHub.
If you would like to support the project, you can do so via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/agentic).
Your support helps keep the project alive and encourages further contributions.

Sometimes there will be a lot of overlap between the models or sections, so please check out each section for more details.
I am working on a section at a time to deep-dive into each topic, so please be patient as I work through them.
