# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized communication protocol designed to enhance interactions between AI models and applications by providing structured context management.

## Overview

MCP enables applications to effectively communicate context, requirements, and constraints to AI models. It provides a standardised way to:

- Share relevant context information
- Define behavior parameters
- Manage conversation history
- Control model outputs

## Key Features

- Structured context management
- Standardised communication format
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Extensible protocol design
- Built-in version control

## Architecture

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to enable AI models to interact seamlessly with external tools and services. It acts as a bridge between AI models and external services, creating a standardized communication
framework that enhances tool integration, accessibility, and AI reasoning capabilities.

### Key Components of MCP

* MCP Host: The AI model (e.g., Azure OpenAI GPT) requesting data or actions.
* MCP Client: An intermediary service that forwards the AI model's requests to MCP servers.
* MCP Server: Lightweight applications that expose specific capabilities (APIs, databases, files, etc.).
* Data Sources: Various backend systems, including local storage, cloud databases, and external APIs.

### Data Flow in MCP

1. The AI model sends a request (e.g., "fetch user profile data").
2. The MCP client forwards the request to the appropriate MCP server.
3. The MCP server retrieves the required data from a database or API.
4. The response is sent back to the AI model via the MCP client.

### MCP Server

The main methods for spinning up an MCP server locally are:

* npx
* uvx
* docker

## MCP with Open WebUI

Open WebUI supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance interactions with AI models. It allows users to define context, requirements, and constraints for model interactions, enabling more effective and controlled
outputs.
More information on using MCP with Open WebUI can be found in the [Open WebUI documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/openapi-servers/mcp/).
