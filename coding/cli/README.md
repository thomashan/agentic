# Coding CLI

For more information on how these tools were obtained, see the [prompt](prompts/research-cli-tools.md).
The tables below only include the tools that were returned by the prompt.
Some tools are hard to evaluate for AI since the name of the CLI tool is the same as the LLM models.
For example, Qwen Code CLI was not treated as different to Qwen Code by some LLM.
