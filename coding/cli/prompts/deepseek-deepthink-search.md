### Tools Added from Research

- **Jan**: An open-source ChatGPT alternative that runs 100% offline. However, it is primarily a chat interface and not designed as a coding-specific CLI tool with autonomous capabilities .
- **LocalAI**: A free, open-source OpenAI alternative that runs LLMs locally. It provides API compatibility but is more of a backend service rather than a standalone CLI tool for autonomous coding .
- **Google AI Studio CLI**: Added due to its CLI capabilities for Gemini models, though it is more focused on prototyping than full autonomy.

### Key Observations:

- **Autonomy**: Tools like Aider, GPT Engineer, Smol Developer, and Open Interpreter offer high autonomy by generating code, executing commands, and managing files with minimal human intervention.
- **Local Model Support**: Many open-source tools (e.g., Aider, Open Interpreter, Smol Developer) support local models via backends like Ollama or vLLM, ensuring privacy and reducing costs.
- **Pricing**: Several tools offer free tiers with usage-based pricing for premium features. Enterprise tools like Amazon Q CLI and Qodo have custom pricing.
- **Planning**: Tools like Plandex and GPT Engineer explicitly use planning to handle complex, multi-step projects.
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Some tools (e.g., Amazon Q CLI, Claude CLI) are part of larger suites, which may limit their flexibility but enhance integration with specific platforms.

### Verification:

All links were verified by visiting the official websites or GitHub repositories. For tools with limited information in the search results, additional web searches were conducted to ensure accuracy.

This list focuses on tools that meet the criteria of autonomous operation. Code assistance tools are listed separately as they do not fully autonomously execute commands or perform file operations.
