## Tools Omitted and Reasons

1. **Forgecode CLI** - Could not find any reliable information or documentation about this tool
2. **Block Goose CLI** - No verifiable information found; may not exist or be discontinued
3. **OpenCode** - Appears to be a model/dataset rather than a CLI tool
4. **OpenAI Codex CLI** - Deprecated; OpenAI Codex API was shut down in March 2023
5. **Cursor CLI** - Cursor is an IDE application, not a CLI tool (though it has AI features)
6. **Windsurf CLI** - Windsurf is an IDE with AI features (Cascade), not a standalone CLI tool

## Notes

- **BYOK** = Bring Your Own Keys (requires API keys from AI providers)
- **Autonomous** = Can perform file operations, execute commands, and generate code with minimal human intervention
- Prices are subject to change and may vary based on usage and API costs
- Local model support typically requires additional setup and configuration
- Most tools require API keys from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google
- Most tools require API keys from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google

I'll help you create a comprehensive table of AI coding CLI tools. Let me search for current information about these tools to ensure accuracy.Based on my research, I'll create comprehensive tables of AI coding CLI tools.
Let me organize them into autonomous tools (that can execute commands, write code, and perform file operations) versus code assistance tools.I've created comprehensive tables comparing AI coding CLI tools based on
extensive research. Here are the key findings:

## Summary of Categorization

**Autonomous CLI Tools (12 tools):** These can execute commands, write code, and perform file operations autonomously:

- Aider works best with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek R1 & Chat V3, OpenAI o1, o3-mini & GPT-4o, but can connect to almost any LLM, including local models
- Claude Code's ability to handle complex, multi-step tasks sets it apart from alternatives
- Cline explores your codebase and works with you to create a comprehensive plan before writing a single line of code
- Gemini CLI provides powerful AI capabilities, from code understanding and file manipulation to command execution and dynamic troubleshooting

**Code Assistance Tools (18 tools):** These focus on code completion and suggestions but lack full autonomous capabilities. This includes tools like GitHub Copilot CLI, Tabnine, and others that primarily offer code
suggestions rather than autonomous execution.

**Key Discoveries:**

1. **Windsurf and Cursor** are IDEs with AI features, not CLI tools
2. **Several tools couldn't be verified:** Forgecode CLI, Block Goose CLI, and OpenCode appear to either not exist or lack documentation
3. **OpenAI Codex CLI** has been deprecated since March 2023
4. **New tools found:** Codex CLI (different from OpenAI's), Aider Desk, and MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Verification Notes:**

- Links to Aider (https://aider.chat/), Claude Code (https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), Cline (https://cline.bot/), and Windsurf (https://windsurf.com/) have been verified as working
- Qwen-Code is forked from Gemini CLI and optimised for Qwen3‑Coder, with free OAuth access 2,000 requests/day
- Most autonomous tools use a "Bring Your Own Keys" (BYOK) model where the software is free but you pay for API usage

The tables show that truly autonomous CLI tools are relatively rare, with most "AI coding tools" being either IDE extensions or code completion services rather than command-line agents capable of autonomous operation.
