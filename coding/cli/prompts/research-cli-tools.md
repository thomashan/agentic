If you are missing information, get the information from the web.
If the tool can't be verified because lack of information, do a more thorough and comprehensive search using multiple search engines.

Especially outline the cli tools I have missed into a separate table.
For the tools I have missed, and you outlined, do thorough research to analyse their functionality, see if the tool is a coding cli tool or a code assistance tool.
For any omitted tools explain why they were omitted.
