It provides a local, sandboxed environment for execution.                     | Extremely powerful and versatile; can install packages, browse the web, and interact with the file system. Excellent for tasks beyond just coding. High degree of control. | Security is a major consideration; you must approve the commands it wants to run (unless using the `-y` flag, which is risky).                | [https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter) | Free      | $0 (API costs) | $0 (API costs)   | Standalone         | Yes          | Yes                 | Native support for a wide range of local execution methods, including Ollama, LM Studio, and custom API endpoints. | Linux, macOS, Windows | No                      | `read files`, `write files`, `execute commands`, `code`, `web search`       | ✅          |
| **Plandex**          | An AI-powered, terminal-based coding engine designed for solving complex, multi-step technical tasks. It creates a detailed, human-readable plan and executes it step-by-step.                                 | The explicit planning step (`plan.md`) is excellent for transparency and control. You can review and modify the plan before execution.                                     | Still a relatively new tool, so it may have rough edges. The planning step adds a bit of overhead for very simple tasks.                      | [https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex](https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex)                       | Free      | $0 (API costs) | $0 (API costs)   | Standalone         | Yes          | Yes                 | Supports local models through providers like Ollama via a configuration file.                                      | Linux, macOS, Windows | Yes                     | `read files`, `write files`, `execute commands`, `code`, `ask user`         | ✅          |

### **Missed or Omitted Tools**

Here is an analysis of the remaining tools from your list and an explanation for their omission from the tables above. Your list was highly comprehensive, and there were no major, verifiable autonomous CLI tools that you
missed.

| Tool Name (from your list)   | Reason for Omission                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AI Shell**                 | This is a generic term. The most popular open-source implementation of this concept is **Shell GPT (sgpt)**, which is included in the "Assistance" table.                                                           |
| **Claude Code**              | Claude is a family of Large Language Models from Anthropic, not a specific CLI tool. Other tools in the tables above can be configured to *use* Claude as their underlying model.                                   |
| **Cline**                    | Could not find a verifiable, active AI coding CLI tool with this name after a comprehensive search. It may be a very niche, new, or deprecated project.                                                             |
| **Continue.dev CLI**         | While it has a CLI component, Continue's primary product is an open-source IDE extension for building custom AI coding assistants. Its CLI is for management, not for autonomous coding tasks.                      |
| **Cursor CLI**               | Cursor is an AI-first code editor, not primarily a CLI tool. While it may have command-line functionality for launching the editor, its core agentic features are within the GUI.                                   |
| **DevChat CLI**              | This is a tool for managing prompts and interacting with models, more akin to a sophisticated chat client than an autonomous agent. It is designed to assist, not to autonomously execute complex tasks.            |
