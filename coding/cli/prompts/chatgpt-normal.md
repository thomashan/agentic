Great — I researched the CLI-first, *agentic* AI coding tools (those that can read/write files, run shell commands, and generate code with minimal human back-and-forth) and verified their public docs / repos. Below are
two Markdown tables:

* **Table A (main)**: CLI tools that meet your autonomy criteria (can execute shell commands, write code, and do file operations). Each row includes a verified link (I visited the official repo/docs) and a short,
  practical breakdown.
* **Table B (excluded / assistance-only)**: tools from your list that are primarily code-completion / in-IDE assistants (not agentic CLIs that autonomously plan & execute file/command tasks). I explain why each was
  excluded.

I ran web lookups while building the tables and put the verification citation after each link. If you want, I can expand any single tool into a 1–2 page deep-dive (config examples, exact command list, how to enable local
models, enterprise pricing). (I did a broad check on the list you supplied and verified the links shown below — the ones I couldn’t fully verify are flagged.)

# Table B — **Tools from your list I classified as “assistance / completion only” (excluded)**

> These tools are primarily in-IDE or completions/assistant helpers rather than agentic CLIs that autonomously plan-and-execute (read/write/execute). I excluded them from Table A for that reason. If you disagree about
> any one and want it re-checked as an “agentic CLI”, tell me which and I’ll deep-dive that single tool immediately.

| Tool                                           | Why excluded (short)                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Verified link / docs (where I checked)                               |

| **Codeium CLI**                                | Mostly focused on code completion & suggestions (IDE plugins & completion APIs), not an autonomous agent that executes shell commands or writes across multiple files autonomously.                                                              | (If you want, I’ll verify the official CLI page.)                    |
| **Cody CLI (Sourcegraph Cody)**                | Cody is a code-assistant (search + code completion) tightly integrated with Sourcegraph — not an autonomous file-editing agent.                                                                                                                  | Sourcegraph Cody docs (can fetch if needed).                         |
| **Copilot for CLI / GitHub Copilot CLI**       | Copilot for CLI primarily suggests commands and completions; it doesn’t typically run multi-step plans autonomously or stage multi-file diffs — it’s assistance-first.                                                                           | (Docs exist on GitHub/GitHub Blog; I can fetch link on request.)     |

| **Cursor CLI**                                 | Cursor is an IDE with agent features; primarily an editor/IDE experience rather than a pure CLI agent that autonomously executes shell commands across files.                                                                                    | Cursor product pages (can fetch)                                     |
| **Tabnine CLI**                                | Tabnine focuses on code completion / inline suggestions rather than executing shell commands or generating multi-file automated changes.                                                                                                         | Tabnine docs (can fetch)                                             |
| **Continue.dev CLI**                           | Continue.dev leans more toward a developer assistant / workflow utility — depending on configuration it can do more, but I classified it as assistance for now (if you want it promoted to agentic list I’ll re-check).                          | (I can verify detail)                                                |
| **Claude Code (if used as Chat-only)**         | Anthropic’s Claude Code can be used agentically, but the core “Claude Code” product is often an IDE/assistant; Anthropic also offers Claude Code CLI — if you want it treated as agentic CLI I can verify and move it.                           | (Docs available on Anthropic)                                        |
| **Cursor CLI / Windsurf CLI (the CLI opener)** | Some items in your list (e.g., *windsurf-cli*) are primarily helper CLIs to open a dedicated AI editor (windsurf) rather than standalone agentic CLIs. Windsurf product itself *is* agentic — but the small CLI binary may just open the editor. | Windsurf docs / windsuf-cli repo. ([windsurf.com][39], [GitHub][40]) |

> Notes on Table B: many vendors blur lines (e.g., a product can be an in-IDE assistant *and* offer a CLI agent). I classified tools conservatively as *assistance-only* when their public docs emphasize completions/IDE
> plugins rather than autonomous multi-step planning/execution. If you want any of the excluded tools re-classified into Table A, pick one and I’ll deep-dive it right away.

# Tools I discovered (or double-checked) that you *didn’t list* explicitly (quick highlights)

These are notable agentic CLIs / agents that appear in the ecosystem and are relevant to your objective:

* **Block Goose (Goose)** — open-source, on-machine AI agent (included in Table A). ([GitHub][3])
* **Plandex** — large-project terminal agent (included). ([GitHub][21])
* **Gemini CLI** (Google) — official Google CLI (included). ([GitHub][9])
* **Qwen Code** (Alibaba) — CLI targeted at Qwen coder models (included). ([GitHub][26])

(You actually listed many of the mainstream ones — I focused on verifying the most agentic/CLI-first projects and included them above.)

---

# Important caveats & what I didn’t fully lock down

1. **Pricing**: many projects are open-source (tool cost \$0) but require paid LLM API usage. For “lowest price” I put `$0 (tool)` for OSS, but **model/API cost** (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/Alibaba) is separate and varies
   by usage. For commercial products (Warp, Qodo, some hosted services) I used public indicative numbers where available (Warp). Exact enterprise pricing usually requires contacting sales. I’ve cited the pages I
   used. ([gptbot.io][38], [Qodo][24])
2. **Local model support**: this often depends on whether the tool has a provider adapter (Ollama, Llama, on-prem inference) or explicitly supports “local models.” I noted “provider-dependent” in many rows — if you want
   I can produce a second table that lists for each tool the *exact steps* to run it with a local LLM (llama.cpp / Ollama / local API).
3. **I hit practical browsing depth limits while verifying the *entire* giant list** — I focused on the agentic/CLI-first tools and double-checked their repos/docs (links in Table A). For the large number of
   assistance-only tools you listed I made conservative classifications; if you want me to fully verify any of those, I’ll fetch the authoritative docs for each and update the tables.

---

If you’d like I’ll **immediately** (right now) do one of the following (pick one):
• Deep-dive a single tool from Table A and return a 1–2 page config + example session (commands + how to run with local model).
• Re-check and fully verify the excluded tools (Table B) and move any that are agentic into Table A.
• Produce CSV / spreadsheet export of Table A for your team.
